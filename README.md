# Chrome Extension Icon Generator

A **Next.js web app** that instantly generates correctly sized icons (`16x16`, `32x32`, `48x48`, `128x128`) and a ready-to-use `manifest.json` for your Chrome extension. You can upload any image, preview all icon sizes, and download individual PNGs or everything in a ZIP file ‚Äì all right in your browser!

## üìÅ How It Works

- Your image is resized on the fly, in the browser, to all required Chrome extension sizes:
  - `16x16`
  - `32x32`
  - `48x48`
  - `128x128`
- Downloads a `manifest.json` preconfigured with your icon filenames and Chrome manifest v3 format.
- No files are uploaded to a server.

## üß© Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [JSZip](https://stuk.github.io/jszip/) (for generating ZIPs client-side)
- [file-saver](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/) (for downloads)

## üì¶ File Structure

- `app/page.tsx`: Main Next.js component with complete logic and UI for the generator.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

- **Manifest:** You may edit the template in the source if you need extra properties.
- **Extra Sizes:** Add or remove sizes in the `ICON_SIZES` array at the top of the file.
- **Branding:** Update colors and UI styles as you wish. The styles use Tailwind CSS classes.

---

## ‚ö° Troubleshooting

- **Blurry Icons?** Use a larger, square PNG as your source for best results.
- **SVG Uploads:** Most SVGs work! Complex SVGs may render differently.
- **Nothing happens?** Make sure your browser supports FileReader, the `<canvas>` API, and JavaScript is enabled.
